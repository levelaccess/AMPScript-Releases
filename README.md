# Instaling the AMPScript into TamperMonkey
If a user hasn't already installed the AMPScript script into TamperMonkey, they should go to the TamperMonkey extension icon in the browser, then to "Dashboard." In the new tab that opens, go to the "Utilities" tab, then paste this URL into the "Import from URL" field:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/levelaccess/AMPScript-Releases/main/AmpScript.js

Once installed this way, TamperMonkey will automatically check for and install updates to the script.
